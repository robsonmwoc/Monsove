# Monsove

Monsove provides an easy way to backup/restore your MongoDB databases to different storage engines using mongodump and mongorestore.

This gem was based on previous experiments with Mongolicious and Mongobacker,
both are very good but limited to use just with S3. Monsove was designed to
allow you to work with any storage, in addition to the capability to restore
your backups when necessary.

## Installation

    gem install monsove
